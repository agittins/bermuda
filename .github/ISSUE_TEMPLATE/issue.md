<!-- Before you open a new issue, search through the existing issues to see if others have had the same problem.

Issues not containing the minimum requirements will be closed:

- Issues without a description (using the header is not good enough) will be closed.
- Issues without debug logging will be closed.
- Issues without configuration will be closed

## Version of the custom_component

<!-- If you are not using the newest version, download and try that before opening an issue
If you are unsure about the version check the const.py file.
-->

## Configuration

<!-- Ideally paste a screenshot of the config dialog from Config -> Integrations -> Bermuda -> CONFIGURE
You can blur out the last 3 or 4 pairs of numbers in each MAC address for privacy reasons, but it's sometimes helpful
to leave the name and the first few digits (as it often gives a clue to the manufacturer).
