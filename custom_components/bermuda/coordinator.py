    Since we are not actually using an external API and only computing local

    very cheap, and the processing process (currently) rather cheap.

    Future improvements:
    - Apply path-loss factor to calculated vectors based on previously measured losses.
    - Fine-tune with real-time measurements from fixed beacons for environmental factors.
    - Implement "radio map" for field strength estimates and wall-crossing attenuation.
