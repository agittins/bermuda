    Class to manage fetching data from the Bluetooth component.

    Since we are not actually using an external API and only computing local
    data already gathered by the bluetooth integration, the update process is
    very cheap, and the processing process (currently) rather cheap.

    TODO / IDEAS:
    - when we get to establishing a fix, we can apply a path-loss factor to
      a calculated vector based on previously measured losses on that path.
      We could perhaps also fine-tune that with real-time measurements from
      fixed beacons to compensate for environmental factors.
    - An "obstruction map" or "radio map" could provide field strength estimates
      at given locations, and/or hint at attenuation by counting "wall crossings"
      for a given vector/path.
