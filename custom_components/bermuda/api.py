"""
Public, stable read API for other integrations.

Bermuda already holds every device/scanner advertisement in memory, whether or
not the corresponding `distance_to` entities are enabled. Consumers that want
those per-scanner readings have historically had to enable the entities and
scrape `sensor.<device>_distance_to_<scanner>` out of the state machine, which
is expensive at scale: on a busy install that is thousands of entities, each
one writing to the recorder and fanning `state_changed` out to every websocket
client.

This module exposes the same data directly, in-process, without creating a
single entity:

    from custom_components.bermuda.api import async_get_advert_snapshot

    snapshot = async_get_advert_snapshot(hass)

For push updates, Bermuda's coordinator is a normal `DataUpdateCoordinator`, so
callers can subscribe with `async_get_coordinator(hass).async_add_listener(cb)`
and take a fresh snapshot when it fires. No extra signal is needed.

The snapshot is deliberately plain JSON-able primitives rather than Bermuda's
internal objects, so consumers do not bind to internal class layout (which does
change). `SNAPSHOT_VERSION` is bumped if the shape changes incompatibly.

    Notes for consumers:

    - `distance` is metres, always. Bermuda's *entities* may render feet
      depending on the user's unit settings; this API does not.
    - `distance` is Bermuda's smoothed value and is None once the reading has
      timed out, which is the "scanner can no longer hear this device" signal.
    - `age` is seconds since this scanner last actually heard the device. That
      is strictly better than an entity's `last_updated` for spotting a stuck
      reading, because it does not depend on the value having changed.
    - Key scanners by their ADDRESS (the dict key / `address` field), not by
      `slug`. Bermuda's `_distance_to_<slug>` entity_ids are frozen at entity
      creation and do not follow later scanner renames, so a slug derived from
      the current name can differ from the historical entity_id. A consumer
      migrating off entity scraping should resolve its stored slugs to scanner
      addresses once via the entity registry (disabled entities are still
      registered, and Bermuda's unique_id embeds the scanner MAC).
