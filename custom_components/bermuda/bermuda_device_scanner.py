        All smoothing and noise-management of the distance between a scanner
        and a device should be done in this method, as it is
        guaranteed to be called on every update cycle, for every
        scanner that has ever reported an advert for this device
        (even if it is not reporting one currently).

        If new_stamp is None it implies that the scanner has not reported
        an updated advertisement since our last update cycle,
        so we may need to check if this device should be timed
        out or otherwise dealt with.

        If new_stamp is not None it means we just had an updated
        rssi_distance_raw value which should be processed.

        This is called by self.update, but should also be called for
        any remaining scanners that have not sent in an update in this
        cycle. This is mainly beacuse usb/bluez adaptors seem to flush
        their advertisement lists quicker than we time out, so we need
        to make sure we still update the scanner entry even if the scanner
        no longer carries advert history for this device.

        Note: Noise in RSSI readings is VERY asymmetric. Ultimately,
        a closer distance is *always* more accurate than a previous
        more distant measurement. Any measurement might be true,
        or it is likely longer than the truth - and (almost) never
        shorter.

        For a new, long measurement to be true, we'd want to see some
        indication of rising measurements preceding it, or at least a
        long time since our last measurement.

        It's tempting to treat no recent measurement as implying an increase
        in distance, but doing so would wreak havoc when we later try to
        implement trilateration, so better to simply cut a sensor off as
        "away" from a scanner when it hears no new adverts. DISTANCE_TIMEOUT
        is how we decide how long to wait, and should accommodate for dropped
        packets and for temporary occlusion (dogs' bodies etc)
