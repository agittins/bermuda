For example, if most of your scanners are ESPHome on a particular board, then choose one of those to use as the reference scanner. Likewise if you have a handful of a particular model of beacon, use one of those as your reference device.\n\n- Choose a device and a scanner below to use as your 'reference pair'\n- Physically place your chosen device at 1m (one metre) from the chosen scanner. Ensure they have a clear line of sight to each other, and avoid having them close to any organic life-forms which might interfere with the signal.\n- Click 'SUBMIT' and note the RSSI values in the table that will appear below. You can click 'SUBMIT' again at any time to refresh the values.\n- Once you have a stable signal strength, put that value into the `reference_power` field and click 'SUBMIT'.\n- You should now see the updated values, and the estimated distances should be close to 1 metre. Repeat as required until you are happy with the result.\n- Now move the device so that it is further from the scanner and measure this distance with a tape measure. Around 5 metres might be a good distance - the exact distance doesn't matter, but keeping a clear line of sight is important, and you might find longer distances will give you more accuracy, generally.\n- With the device at the new distance, click 'SUBMIT' again and you should see the most recent measurements will reflect the new distance, but will probably be inaccurate.\n- Experiment with different values for `attenuation` and clicking 'SUBMIT', until you get the estimated measurements to agree with your physical measurement.\n- Once you are happy with the calibration, tick 'Save and Close' and click 'SUBMIT'.\n{details_end}\n{suffix}",
