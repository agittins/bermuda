"""Bermuda's internal representation of a bluetooth device.

Each discovered bluetooth device (ie, every found transmitter) will
have one of these entries created for it. These are not HA 'devices' but
our own internal thing. They directly correspond to the entries you will
see when calling the dump_devices service call.

Even devices which are not configured/tracked will get entries created
for them, so we can use them to contribute towards measurements."""
