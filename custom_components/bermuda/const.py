UPDATE_INTERVAL = 1.05  # Seconds between bluetooth data processing cycles
# Note: this is separate from the CONF_UPDATE_INTERVAL which allows the
# user to indicate how often sensors should update. We need to check bluetooth
# stats often to get good responsiveness for beacon approaches and to make
# the smoothing algo's easier. But sensor updates should bear in mind how
# much data it generates for databases and browser traffic.

# Some warnings, like not having an area assigned to a scanner, are important for
# users to see and act on, but we don't want to spam them on every update. This
# value in seconds is how long we wait between emitting a particular error message
# when encountering it - primarily for our update loop.

# Beacon-handling constants. Source devices are tracked by MAC-address and are the
# originators of beacon-like data. We then create a "meta-device" for the beacon's
# uuid. Other non-static-mac protocols should use this method as well, by adding their
# own BEACON_ types.

# Device entry pruning. Letting the gathered list of devices grow forever makes the
# processing loop slower. It doesn't seem to have as much impact on memory, but it
# would certainly use up more, and gets worse in high "traffic" areas.
#
# Pruning ignores tracked devices (ie, ones we keep sensors for) and scanners. It also
# avoids pruning the most recent IRK for a known private device.
