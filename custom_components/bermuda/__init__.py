    Since we are not actually using an external API and only computing local
    data already gathered by the bluetooth integration, the update process is
    very cheap, and the processing process (currently) rather cheap.

    Future work / algo's etc to keep in mind:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality
    - with distance to two rx nodes, we can apply min and max bounds
      on the distance between them (less than the sum, more than the
      difference). This could allow us to iterively approximate toward
      the rx layout, esp as devices move between (and right up to) rx.
      - bear in mind that rssi errors are typically attenuation-only.
        This means that we should favour *minimum* distances as being
        more accurate, both when weighting measurements from distant
        receivers, and when whittling down a max distance between
        receivers (but beware of the min since that uses differences)

    https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/applsci/applsci-10-02003/article_deploy/applsci-10-02003.pdf?version=1584265508
    - lots of good info and ideas.

    TODO / IDEAS:
    - when we get to establishing a fix, we can apply a path-loss factor to
      a calculated vector based on previously measured losses on that path.
      We could perhaps also fine-tune that with real-time measurements from
      fixed beacons to compensate for environmental factors.
    - An "obstruction map" or "radio map" could provide field strength estimates
      at given locations, and/or hint at attenuation by counting "wall crossings"
      for a given vector/path.
